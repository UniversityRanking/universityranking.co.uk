  <h1 style="font-size: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; text-align: center;">Entry Requirements: The Numbers Don’t Add Up</h1>

  <p>The Guardian League Table lists the <strong>University of Glasgow</strong> as number 1 in the UK for “qualifications on entry”, showing an average of <strong>227 UCAS points</strong>.</p>

  <p>Sounds impressive, right? But what does that number actually mean? <strong>It makes up 15% of Glasgow’s entire Guardian ranking — despite being based on data that can be wildly misleading.</strong></p>

  <img src="[https://universityranking.co.uk/assets/images/Guardian-Glasgow-227.png" alt="Guardian League Table showing Glasgow at 227 points" style="max-width:100%; margin: 1rem 0; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 8px;">

  <h2 style="font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem;">Let’s Break It Down</h2>

  <p>The Guardian explain their methodology: they calculate the <em>average tariff score</em> of first-year, full-time, under-21 students. But only if their qualifications can be converted into UCAS points. That’s already a big caveat — and it gets murkier from there.</p>

  <p><strong>227 UCAS points</strong> is the equivalent of <em>just over four A*s</em> at A-level. Here's a quick refresher on how UCAS points work:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A* = 56 points</li>
    <li>A = 48 points</li>
    <li>B = 40 points</li>
    <li>C = 32 points</li>
    <li>D = 24 points</li>
    <li>E = 16 points</li>
  </ul>

  <p>So you might think Glasgow are only accepting students with straight A*s and nothing less.</p>

  <h2 style="font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem;">But Here’s the Twist</h2>

  <p>If you head over to <a href="https://digital.ucas.com/coursedisplay/courses/5368b588-9266-655a-f467-1c5893ec5eaa?academicYearId=2025" target="_blank">UCAS’s official data for Accounting and Finance at Glasgow</a>, the actual picture is very different.</p>

  <p>According to UCAS, the <strong>highest grade profile</strong> accepted was <strong>A*A*A</strong>. Not four A*s. Not five. Just three subjects. Already that’s well below the 227 average The Guardian imply.</p>

  <p>Even more telling: the <strong>lowest accepted profile</strong> was <strong>BBC</strong>. That’s a total of <strong>112 UCAS points</strong> — <em>less than half</em> the supposed average.</p>

  <p>So… what’s going on?</p>

  <h2 style="font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem;">The Problem With Averages</h2>

  <p>League tables love averages — but averages don’t tell the whole story. They can be skewed by a small number of students with lots of qualifications. Think: students with extra Highers, BTECs, Extended Projects, or international qualifications that convert to big tariff numbers.</p>

  <p>And remember: the Guardian’s figure <em>excludes</em> students whose qualifications don’t convert cleanly to UCAS points — which might disproportionately cut out contextual offers, mature students, or those entering with vocational routes.</p>

  <h2 style="font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem;">So What Should You Trust?</h2>

  <p><strong>Don’t obsess over “qualifications on entry” scores — especially when they make up 15% of a university’s league table position.</strong> They’re not what universities <em>ask for</em>, and they’re definitely not what all students actually get.</p>

  <p>Instead, go straight to the source: <a href="https://www.ucas.com" target="_blank">UCAS</a> now shows the actual grades that were accepted on each course, not just what was advertised. That gives you a much clearer idea of where you stand.</p>

  <p>Confused by the league tables? You should be. That’s why <strong>UniversityRanking.co.uk</strong> focuses on what actually matters — how students experienced their course once they got there.</p>

  <p><strong>Because what you bring in matters less than what you get out.</strong></p>
