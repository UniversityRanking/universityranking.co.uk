<h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>

<h2>❓ What is UniversityRanking.co.uk?</h2>
<p><strong>UniversityRanking.co.uk</strong> is a student-first alternative to traditional league tables. It ranks UK universities and courses based entirely on how past students rated their experience in the National Student Survey (NSS). No research metrics. No PR spin. Just honest feedback from students who’ve been there.</p>

<h2>❓ What makes this different from The Guardian or Complete University Guide?</h2>
<p>Most league tables mix in metrics like research income, staff-to-student ratios, and entry tariffs — which often have little to do with your actual experience on the course.  
We focus on what really matters to students: teaching, support, resources, mental health services, and feedback — the things you’ll feel every day.</p>

<h2>❓ Is this based on real data?</h2>
<p>Yes. All rankings are based on the UK government’s <strong>National Student Survey (NSS)</strong> results, which capture feedback from over 300,000 final-year students each year. We don’t edit the scores — we just present them in a way that’s easier to compare and understand.</p>

<h2>❓ Who runs this site?</h2>
<p>The site was created by <strong>Adam Finkel-Gates</strong>, a former university lecturer who’s taught at Russell Group institutions and won national recognition for student support. He believes university should lead to a proper graduate career — and that students deserve honest insight before committing.</p>

<h2>❓ How often is the data updated?</h2>
<p>Every year. The rankings are refreshed each summer as soon as the latest NSS results are released by the Office for Students. That way, you’re always seeing the most up-to-date feedback from current students.</p>

<h2>❓ Can universities pay to improve their ranking?</h2>
<p>Absolutely not. We don’t accept payment to boost any university or suppress negative data. The rankings are algorithmically generated based on NSS scores, and any future advertising will be clearly marked and will not affect the rankings.</p>

<h2>❓ Why don’t you show entry standards or graduate salaries?</h2>
<p>Because those numbers can be misleading. Entry grades published in league tables rarely reflect what’s offered via clearing or contextual admissions. And salary data often ignores regional differences, industry sectors, or part-time work.  
We focus on what your <strong>experience</strong> will actually be like — not what the marketing says it might be.</p>

<h2>❓ Is this an official government site?</h2>
<p>No. This is an independent project using publicly available government data. We are not affiliated with any university, agency, or government department.</p>

<h2>❓ I found an error — what should I do?</h2>
<p>Please let us know! Email <a href="mailto:hello@universityranking.co.uk">hello@universityranking.co.uk</a> with a quick note. We’ll check it out and correct anything that needs fixing.</p>

<h2>❓ I’m a teacher or advisor — can I use this in guidance sessions?</h2>
<p>Yes — and we’d love that. Everything on the site is free to access, with no sign-up required. If you’d like printable handouts or a tailored resource for your school, just get in touch and we’ll do our best to help.</p>
