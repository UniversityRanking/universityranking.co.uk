  <h1>🧠 How Our Rankings Work (Methodology)</h1>
  <p>At <strong>UniversityRanking.co.uk</strong>, we believe that the best way to choose a university is to hear from students who’ve actually been there and done it. That’s why our rankings are based <strong>entirely on what students say about their experience</strong> – not on research, reputation, or entry grades.</p>

  <h2>📋 What is the NSS?</h2>
  <p>Our rankings are based on something called the <strong>National Student Survey (NSS)</strong>. This is a survey run every year across the UK where students in their final year of undergraduate study are asked to rate their university experience.</p>
  <p>Each student is asked the <strong>same 28 questions</strong>, covering everything from teaching quality to academic support, feedback, mental wellbeing services, and more. For each question, students choose how much they agree or disagree.</p>
  <p>We then use this data – not marketing, not league tables, just <strong>real answers from real students</strong>.</p>

  <h2>📊 Which answers do we use?</h2>
  <p>We use the <strong>“positivity” score</strong> for each question – that means the percentage of students who either <strong>agree</strong> or <strong>strongly agree</strong> with the statement. For example, if 80% of students agreed or strongly agreed that their course was intellectually stimulating, the score would be <strong>80%</strong>.</p>
  <p>We only include answers from <strong>all undergraduate students</strong> – not just final-year students, so it gives a fuller picture of student experience across the course.</p>

  <h2>❌ Questions we leave out</h2>
  <p>The NSS includes 28 questions in total, but we only use <strong>26</strong> in our rankings.</p>
  <p>That’s because <strong>Question 27 and Question 28</strong> are not asked in all four nations of the UK – only in England. To keep the comparison fair between universities in <strong>Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, and England</strong>, we’ve removed these two questions from our calculations.</p>

  <h2>📆 Smoothing out the data: Using multiple years</h2>
  <p>To avoid giving too much weight to a single year of results (which might be affected by things like a temporary issue with a course or a new building being renovated), we combine <strong>two years of data</strong> when calculating scores:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>For the 2024 rankings, we use <strong>2024 and 2023</strong> data</li>
    <li>For the 2023 rankings, we use <strong>2023 and 2022</strong> data</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Each year is weighted <strong>equally (50/50)</strong> in our calculations.</p>
  <p>If a university or subject doesn’t have data published for both years, we <strong>don’t include it</strong> – this helps make sure our rankings are based on complete, reliable data.</p>

  <h2>🧮 How we calculate the scores</h2>
  <p>Each university gets a <strong>score out of 100%</strong> for every one of the 26 included questions.</p>
  <p>Each question is weighted <strong>equally</strong> – that means each one contributes <strong>1/26th</strong> of the final score.</p>
  <p>We then average the 26 scores to create an overall score.</p>

  <h2>💡 What we include – and what we don’t</h2>
  <p><strong>✅ We include</strong> all UK universities that appear in the <strong>official NSS dataset</strong> published by the Office for Students (OfS).</p>
  <p><strong>❌ We remove</strong> small colleges and specialist institutions like drama schools and conservatoires. We’ve done this to match what other league tables do, so it’s easier for you to compare.</p>

  <h2>🖥 How the scores are shown</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>On the homepage and subject pages, we show scores to <strong>two decimal places</strong> – for example, <strong>83.17%</strong></li>
    <li>When you click on a university to view full question-by-question scores, we round each individual score to the <strong>nearest whole number</strong> – for example, <strong>83%</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🛠 Our Customiser Tool</h2>
  <p>We know not everyone cares about the same things. Maybe <strong>mental health support</strong> is a priority for you. Maybe you want to focus on <strong>teaching quality</strong> or <strong>assessment feedback</strong>.</p>
  <p>That’s where our <strong>Customiser</strong> tool comes in.</p>
  <p>You can adjust how important each of the 26 questions is to <strong>you personally</strong>, using sliders that go from:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>-50%</strong> (makes that question count less – or even reduce a score)</li>
    <li><strong>0%</strong> (ignore the question entirely)</li>
    <li><strong>+50%</strong> (make that question count more)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We’ll then recalculate the rankings based on your preferences.</p>

  <h2>📦 Where the data comes from</h2>
  <p>We only use data published directly by the <strong>Office for Students (OfS)</strong> – the same public source used by universities, government, and other league tables.</p>
  <p>The NSS is updated each year, and so is our site.</p>

  <h2>🔚 In short…</h2>
  <p>No gimmicks. No prestige scores. No marketing fluff.</p>
  <p>Just clear, honest data from the students who came before you – so you can make the best decision about where to study.</p>
