# Our Methodology

Choosing a university is a big decision. After all, you’re committing at least three years of your life, not to mention a significant financial investment and the stress of academic life. It’s easy to get swept up in glossy marketing materials, pictures of shiny new classrooms, and the carefully curated opening days led by hand-picked student ambassadors. But do these really tell you what your chosen university is actually like?

Wouldn’t it be incredible if every final-year student could share their honest thoughts about their university experience? Well, they do! The **National Student Survey (NSS)** asks 28 questions of every final-year student in the UK, and the results are publicly available on the Office for Students website. However, the data has never been used to rank universities or compare them against each other – something that might make some prestigious universities a little uncomfortable.

At **University Ranking**, we believe that if you’re investing £40,000+ into your education, you deserve to know what your university is really like, beyond the marketing spin.

We’ve examined the 28 questions answered by over **340,000 students** each year, a response rate of 70% out of the 500,000 final-year students in the UK. To make our analysis fair, we’ve excluded two questions (Q27 and Q28), as they are only asked of students in Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, not English universities. This ensures that we are comparing apples to apples.

We’ve then treated each of the 26 remaining questions equally, assigning each one a weight of **1/26th** of the final score. We take the positivity measure for each of these 26 questions from the Office for Student Data and calculate an average.

Additionally, we don’t just look at one year’s worth of data. We average out the results from previous years as well, so we’re considering answers from a total of **640,000 students**, not just the current 340,000. This way, we’re sharing and comparing feedback from a broader student base in our university ranking.

# What is the National Student Survey?

The **National Student Survey (NSS)** is a nationwide survey in the UK that gathers feedback from final-year undergraduates about their university experience. It’s conducted annually by the Office for Students (OfS) and asks students 28 questions on areas such as teaching quality, student support, learning resources, and more. The survey results provide valuable insights into students’ experiences and help future students make informed decisions about their university choice.
