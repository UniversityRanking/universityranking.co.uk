  <h1 style="font-size: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; text-align: center;">How We Rank Universities (No Nonsense)</h1>

  <p>Choosing a university is a big deal. You're investing 3+ years of your life and probably £40k+ in tuition and living costs. So you’d think university rankings would be designed for <em>you</em>, the student… but they’re not.</p>

  <p>The Guardian League Table, for example, gives 15% of the score to entry requirements (which can be misleading), 15% to staff-to-student ratios (which tell you nothing about actual class sizes), and just 10% to student satisfaction — arguably the one thing a university can control!</p>

  <p>Let’s break that down:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Entry requirements:</strong> Some universities publish higher offers than they actually accept. Some bizarre data/facts - read more here.</li>
    <li><strong>Staff:student ratio:</strong> When you see "1:20" it doesn't suggest you'll have lectures with another 120 plus students.</li>
    <li><strong>Expenditure per student:</strong> This includes research and central university costs — not just teaching or your department.</li>
    <li><strong>Career prospects:</strong> A uni might take credit for students who got jobs through their own hustle.</li>
    <li><strong>Student satisfaction:</strong> Gets the smallest weighting… when it should probably be the biggest.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>So we flipped it. What if universities were ranked by the people who actually experienced them — the final year students?</p>

  <h2 style="font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem;">Enter the National Student Survey (NSS)</h2>

  <p>Every year, over <strong>340,000 final year students</strong> in the UK are asked 28 questions about their university experience. It covers:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Teaching quality</li>
    <li>Learning opportunities</li>
    <li>Assessment and feedback</li>
    <li>Academic support</li>
    <li>Organisation and management</li>
    <li>Learning resources</li>
    <li>Student voice</li>
    <li>Mental wellbeing services</li>
  </ul>

  <p>That’s basically everything you’d want to know. How helpful are lecturers? Is feedback useful? Are you actually supported? Is the place well run?</p>

  <p>But here’s the thing: this data is public, but it’s messy. That’s where <strong>UniversityRanking.co.uk</strong> steps in.</p>

  <h2 style="font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem;">How Our Rankings Work</h2>

  <p>We take the 26 questions that apply to all UK universities (Q27 and Q28 are specific to certain nations, so we exclude them for fairness).</p>

  <p><strong>One important note:</strong> The NSS changed some of its questions in 2023, which makes year-on-year comparisons tricky. To keep things fair, we only included 2023 questions that have a clear counterpart in 2022 — ones that ask essentially the same thing, even if the wording is slightly different. That way, when we average across years, we're comparing like with like.</p>

  <p>Want to see exactly how we matched the questions? <a href="/NSS-question-mapping,html">Check out the full breakdown.</a></p> -->
  
  <p>Each question counts equally — that’s <strong>1/26th</strong> of the total score. Then we average the results across the past two years (e.g. 2025 and 2024) so no uni gets a fluke result.</p>

  <p>In total, we’re looking at feedback from <strong>around 640,000 students</strong>.</p>

  <h2 style="font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem;">Want More Control?</h2>

  <p>Use our <a href="/customiser">Customiser</a> tool to change how much each question matters to you. Want to give extra weight to mental health support? Go for it. Think assessment feedback is crucial? Boost it.</p>

  <p>You’re in control of what matters in your ranking.</p>

  <h2 style="font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem;">A Final Note</h2>

  <p>Universities <em>do</em> encourage students to complete the NSS, often offering freebies or incentives. Why? Because satisfied students can balance out negative reviews. That’s the game. We just show you the results — no spin, no PR, just the data.</p>

  <p>Welcome to University Ranking. Real students. Real rankings.</p>
